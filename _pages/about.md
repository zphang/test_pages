I am a second-year Masters student at the NYU Center for Data Science. 

I am interested in studying interpretability methods for deep learning models. I am currently working with [Krzysztof Geras](https://cs.nyu.edu/~kgeras/) on deep learning methods for breast cancer detection and [Sam Bowman](https://www.nyu.edu/projects/bowman/) on natural language understanding.

I graduated from the University of Chicago in 2015, where I majored in Mathematics, Statistics and Economics.

I previously worked at AQR Capital Management where I applied machine learning to short-term alpha research as part of the Managed Futures team. I also previously interned at Old Mission Capital, doing research on high-frequency data.
